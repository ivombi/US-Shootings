## Introduction

On January 27th 2021, the Washington Post reported 984 people were shot and killed by the police in 2020. The rate at which black Americans are killed by police is more than twice as high as the rate for white Americans [source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/). Amongst the killings was that of George Perry Floyd Jr, an unarmed black man that was reported been killed by an officer who knelt on his neck for 8mins and 46 seconds. This sparked an outrage in the US marked by weeks of unrest all over the country. This incident and many others has motivated the current president, Joe Biden to issue series of executive orders to address racial inequality in federal policy.
